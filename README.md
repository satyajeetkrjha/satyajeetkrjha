### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I am pursuing MS, in Computer Engineering(2021 August -2023 May) from Syracuse University,New York. Before this, I have been a software developer for three years. I am an engineer at heart with a solid understanding of algorithms and data structures. I am also an active competitive coder
